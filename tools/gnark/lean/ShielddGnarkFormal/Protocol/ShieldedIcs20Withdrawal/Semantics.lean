Handwritten fixed-shape shielded ICS-20 withdrawal semantics.

Payload validation and chain-state execution are explicit external facts; the
circuit relation binds their typed result into the public statement. Honest
wallet construction is modeled separately from consensus acceptance.

  If `outboundAssetId` has a current native policy, that policy cross-indexes
  the `paramsHash` and `ringHash` committed under `assetAnchor` and authorizes
  the route and fields in the effect-hashed payload. A regulated memo has the
  one canonical wrapper and embeds the same outbound asset ID. An asset absent
  from the current registry follows the unregulated runtime branch.

  Every current leaf committed by the user root binds the complete address,

  Stateless validation admits one canonical embedded payload encoding and
  rejects every deprecated compatibility or otherwise noncanonical encoding

  address.

/-! Abstract specification and soundness bridge for the quad (4-ary) Merkle path.

The extracted `QuadPath2.circuit` is `to_binary` of the position into 2-bit
per-layer indices, a chain of `quadPathRound` calls, and a final `eq` to the
claimed root. Each `quadPathRound` is select-wiring that places `Current` among
its three siblings according to the two index bits, followed by one
`poseidonPerm4` call (the per-node hash).

This module mirrors `proven-zk`'s `Merkle.recover` at arity 4: the per-node hash
`H4` is kept abstract (a parameter), so this layer proves the *path composition*
independently of the Poseidon bridge (M4), which supplies the concrete `H4`. -/

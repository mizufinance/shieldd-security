/*
 * orbis-authorization.als — designated decryptability of the Orbis
 * re-encryption (PRE) authorization, at the on-chain boundary.
 *
 * Scope: design-level. The Orbis committee / DKG / quorum state is off-chain
 * and NOT modeled here; this captures the on-chain authorization relation that
 * Shieldd verifies. Group/DLEQ algebra is abstracted to a structural binding of
 * each re-encryption commitment to exactly one issuer key. The cryptographic
 * binding behind that abstraction is tracked in the assumption ledger:
 *   - CC-ASSUME-PRE-BINDING  (the DLEQ + PRE construction binds xnc_cmt to a
 *                                single issuer key; the DLEQ core is mechanized
 *                                in Lean lean-dleq as DLEQ-FS-KNOWLEDGE-SOUNDNESS)
 *
 * Sources of truth (Rust):
 *   crates/core/component/compliance/src/orbis_interop.rs
 *     compute_reencrypt_commitment / verify_reencrypt_proof / recover_seed
 *
 * Mirrors the Tamarin `DESIGNATED_DECRYPTABILITY` property at the system level.
 *
 * Assertions:
 *   CorrectIssuerRecovers   — the bound issuer recovers exactly the sealed seed.
 *   OnlyDesignatedRecovers  — no other issuer recovers anything (designated
 *                             decryptability / no cross-issuer recovery).
 *   SingleBinding           — a commitment binds exactly one issuer key.

U-shared: abstract pairing structure and the named cryptographic assumption
definitions shared by all proof units. Assumptions are named `Prop`
definitions consumed as explicit hypotheses (see DESIGN.md); each maps 1:1 to
a `formal-handoff.md` assumption row. No axioms — the `just snarkpack-fv`
gate tolerates `axiom` only in this file as an escape hatch, but the intended
state is axiom-free.

/-- q-SDH-type KZG structured-key binding and z-challenge SZ step.

    `srs` is the structured commitment-key basis (the SRS powers `h·βⁱ` / `g·αⁱ`
    the opening is checked against). `accept z coeffs key opening` abstracts the
    verifier's pairing check on a claimed final key `key` and opening proof
    `opening` for the transcript polynomial with coefficients `coeffs` at the KZG
    challenge `z` — its concrete instance is
    `verify_commitment_key_g{1,2}_kzg_opening` in `tipa/mod.rs`. For every `z`,
    an accepted pair pins the key to the honest structured MSM. This row bundles
    q-SDH binding with the z-challenge Schwartz--Zippel step; failure of the
    required z-goodness condition is a bad event. This is an explicit
    proposition, never a Lean axiom; the concrete reductions and
    `KZG-FALSE-OPENING-SECURITY` ledger assumption account for it. -/

/-- AFGHO/double-pairing commitment binding used by the GIPA reduction.

    The idealization of binding for the pairing-based vector commitment
    `v ↦ ∑ᵢ cm(ckᵢ, vᵢ)` at keys `ck`: the commitment map is injective on
    messages. Computationally justified by the AFGHO double-pairing (SXDH-type)
    binding of the TIPP/MIPP commitments. U2 consumes it only to pin child
    openings to canonical folds; `Ipp.binding_foldMsg` transports it to the
    folded keys, so the assumption surface stays at the SRS keys. This is an
    explicit proposition, never a Lean axiom; the concrete fork-knowledge
    reduction and ledger assumption account for it. -/

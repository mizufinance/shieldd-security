# CI gate for the emitted-Lean semantic anti-pattern linter
# (scripts/lint-emitted-lean.py). Two parts:
#
#   1. Self-test: the linter MUST fail (exit 2) on the deliberately-bad fixture
#      and pass (exit 0) on the good fixture. This proves the rules still fire,
#      independent of any generator state.
#   2. Live check: freshly generate the StructuredLC Rust contracts and assert
#      the linter's hard-fail rules PASS on them (current green generation must
#      not contain a fuel-unroll / wide-carried-rcases / >8-arm-match).
#
# The obsolete per-deployment adapter trees have been removed. This live probe
# checks freshly generated seated contracts; normalized provider sources are
# covered by the emitted-source heartbeat/census gates in the outer FV driver.
